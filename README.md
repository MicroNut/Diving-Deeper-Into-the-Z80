# Description

Come with me on an adventure discovering how the logic of the Zilog Z80 computer processing unit works. I'll be diving deep into the following
* Registers - Where all values are stored

*  ALU - The arithmetic logic unit. Where all the logic is handled.

*  PLA - The programmable logic array. The decoder that reads the operation codes and directs them to the correct logic function

* Timing - the timing of the read, write and other cycles

* Control - The traffic cop directing the bus and control lines

* Putting it all together - Making a Z80 simulated system using VGA, 7 segment displays, 4x4 keypad and serial io using [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) logic simulator.

# Status 
In progress - Working on the Register section
